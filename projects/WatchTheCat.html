                <p>
                    This interaction system uses a forward raycast as the core of all player interactions.
                    The raycast constantly checks what the player is looking at and determines whether the object in front of them is interactable.
                    If the raycast hits an object that supports interaction, the system verifies whether the player is allowed to interact with it at that moment.
                    When the object confirms that interaction is possible, it returns an icon to the UI, showing the player exactly what type of action can be performed.

                <p>
                    The hiding box is built on top of the interaction system.
                    When the player looks at a box, the icon appears to show that hiding is possible.
                    After interacting, the player automatically jumps into the box in a smooth animation.
                    Inside the box, the mouse becomes invisible to the cat and can safely wait or observe the environment.
                    The player stays hidden until they choose to jump out again, giving them a moment to breathe, plan their next move, or escape danger.
                    This system makes hiding feel natural and responsive and reinforces the core tension of the game.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Dialogue System</h3>

                <p>
                    I first built the dialogue system by writing every line directly inside Unity.
                    It worked for quick tests, but it became messy fast.
                    Changing a line, adding a new scene or fixing a typo meant going into scripts,
                    searching through objects and hoping nothing broke.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/watchthecat/DialogueSystem.gif" class="wtc-dialogue-gif">

                <p>
                    To make the system easier to work with, I moved everything to Excel.
                    Each row now represents a single dialogue line and contains the speaker,
                    the text, a sound event and a few small settings that control how the line behaves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Updating or adding dialogue is now as simple as editing a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/watchthecat/NPCDialoguescreenshot.png" class="wtc-img-inline">

                <p>
                    Every NPC has a DialogueIndexID.
                    This ID decides which group of lines they should use at that moment in the story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I talk to an NPC, the DialogueManager only receives this ID,
                    looks up the matching lines in the Excel file and sends the result to the UI.
                    The UI doesn’t know what it gets — it just shows whatever the manager returns.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/watchthecat/DialogueManager.png" class="wtc-img-inline">

                <p>
                    If an NPC runs out of lines for the active ID, the system automatically switches to their default dialogue.
                    Moving the story forward is just as simple: increasing the NPC's index jumps them to the next part of their conversation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This keeps everything clean and separated.
                    NPCs only store an index, the manager only fetches data and the UI only displays it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This setup makes the dialogue system easy to maintain and scale.
                    I can add new conversations, story steps, sound triggers or conditions without touching Unity itself.
                    NPCs react correctly as long as they’re given the right index.
                    Triggering events after a conversation is also simple: I only need to fill in a string inside the Excel file.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Push Object System</h3>

                <img src="/img/watchthecat/Pushobject.gif" class="wtc-img-medium">

                <p>
                    The Push Object System is designed to make pushing objects feel physical and believable for a small mouse.
                    When the player jumps against a box, the system handles the movement, sound and recoil in one smooth animation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system first checks from which side the player approaches the object.
                    Each box only accepts pushes from specific angles, preventing unrealistic behaviour
                    and making level design more controlled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When interacting, the player performs a small jump toward the box, hits it,
                    and then hops backward as recoil. Meanwhile the box slides back using an animation curve,
                    giving the push weight and personality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every pushable object has its own editable settings in the Unity inspector:
                    push distance, movement speed, allowed direction, recoil strength and the maximum number of pushes.
                    This makes each instance easy to tune without extra coding.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/watchthecat/Pushbox.png" class="wtc-img-small">

                <p>
                    When a box reaches its movement limit, it can trigger an event in the world.
                    This is done simply by writing an event name in the inspector, allowing the system to open doors,
                    activate triggers or update quests.

                <p>
                    A modular, component-based framework that unifies all player–object interactions.
                    Every interactable object inherits the same base logic for detection, validation and execution,
                    while implementing its own custom behavior. This keeps interactions consistent, prevents duplicated
                    code, and allows new interaction types to be added with minimal impact on the rest of the system.

                    Systems register for specific events and react only when needed, resulting in a loosely-coupled
                    structure. It coordinates quests, triggers NPC behavior, updates story progression and allows
                    different systems to communicate without direct dependencies.

                    Integrated FMOD middleware handles all spatial and dynamic audio in the game.
                    Sound events are triggered in real-time based on movement, distance, surface types and world states.
                    This includes footsteps, object interactions, ambient layers and tension cues, creating an adaptive
                    audio environment that directly supports the stealth mechanics.
