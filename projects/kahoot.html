        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a real-time multiplayer quiz platform inspired by Kahoot. It was developed as a complete
            full-stack school assignment, where the goal was to build a fully functioning interactive quiz system that
            supports real-time communication. The platform consists of two separate Angular applications — a Host
            interface and a Player interface — that both communicate with a shared .NET backend using SignalR.
            All quiz data, sessions and player results are stored inside a Dockerized SQL Server environment, managed
            through Entity Framework Core.
            To support a stable workflow, the project also includes an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds and validates
            every update, preventing broken code from being merged and keeping development smooth and reliable.

        <h2>Core Application Systems</h2>

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Host Application</h3>
                <p>
                    The Host application controls the entire quiz session. It was built with Angular and follows a
                    component-based structure, where every part of the workflow is separated. This includes selecting
                    questions, starting rounds, showing correct answers, and monitoring the live results coming in from
                    players.
                    By keeping the structure modular, the host UI stays organized and easy to expand. The host receives
                    real-time updates from the backend, ensuring that every incoming answer appears instantly. This creates
                    a fast and responsive quiz experience that feels smooth for both the host and the players.
                </p>

            <div class="wtc-half">
                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Player Application</h3>
                <p>
                    The Player application is a clean and lightweight Angular project designed for speed.
                    When the host launches a new question, the player receives the update instantly through SignalR.
                    This makes answering feel immediate, no matter how many players are connected.
                    The UI is intentionally simple: it only shows the current question, available answers and minimal
                    feedback. This keeps the experience fast, readable and accessible across different devices and screen
                    sizes. All answers are sent directly to the backend without delay, ensuring that the results are
                    synchronized in real time.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Real-Time Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Real-time communication is fully powered by SignalR. The backend broadcasts updates — such as new
                    questions, lobby status, timer values and answer results — to all connected clients at the same time.
                    Players send their answers to the hub, which forwards the information directly to the host.
                    This communication loop was tested extensively to ensure it stays responsive and stable. Without this
                    real-time layer, the quiz would lose the fast and interactive feel that defines it.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Login & Session Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    Before implementing the login and session flow, I created a sequence diagram mapping every interaction
                    between the frontends, the backend and the database. This visualized how a session is created, how
                    players join using a code, and how the backend validates each step.
                    Having a clear communication diagram prevented confusion later in development and made the system
                    easier to maintain. Every part of the login flow became predictable, which reduced bugs and kept both
                    applications perfectly in sync with the backend.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">ASP.NET Core API</h3>
                <p>
                    The backend was built using ASP.NET Core and handles all major quiz systems. It processes quiz
                    questions, validates answers, manages player sessions and coordinates all real-time updates.
                    I structured the API using a layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories), keeping the
                    code easy to maintain, test and expand. This modular design allowed new features to be added without
                    breaking existing functionality.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Entity Framework Core</h3>
                <p>
                    All persistent quiz data — players, questions, answers and session details — is stored using
                    Entity Framework Core. The database runs inside a Docker SQL Server container, ensuring that every
                    team member works with the exact same environment.
                    EF Core migrations were used throughout the project to update and maintain the database structure
                    without losing data or causing version conflicts.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">SignalR Hub</h3>
                <p>
                    The SignalR hub synchronizes both Angular applications with the backend in real time. It broadcasts
                    events from the host to all players and collects incoming answers instantly. This hub is the central
                    communication layer of the entire platform.
                    Without it, the quiz would not function as a real-time system. The hub ensures that everything stays
                    synchronized regardless of connection speed or number of players.

                <p>
                    A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and validates both Angular applications and the
                    .NET backend after each commit. This automated workflow prevents broken code from reaching the main
                    branch and guarantees that every update follows a consistent quality standard.
                    It simulates a professional environment where automated tests and checks are essential for reliable
                    software development.

                <p>
                    SonarQube was used to analyze the backend for issues such as duplicated code, complexity problems and
                    maintainability warnings. The tool identified weak spots early in development, allowing them to be
                    fixed before they caused larger issues.
                    This significantly improved the quality of the codebase and made the entire system easier to extend.

                <h3 class="wtc-sub">Docker SQL Server</h3>
                <p>
                    The SQL Server database runs entirely inside a Docker container, which eliminates local configuration
                    differences and ensures a reproducible environment across all machines.
                    This made development much more predictable and allowed the database to be reset, rebuilt or shared
                    quickly without manual setup. It also ensured that the backend, EF Core migrations and both Angular
                    applications always targeted the same consistent environment.
