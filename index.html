        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Luuk. I’m a junior software engineer with a strong focus on backend and full-stack development.
            I'm good at breaking down complex problems, structuring them in a clear and logical way, and turning them
            into clean, reliable code. I work with modern software development practices such as clean
            architecture, API-driven design, version control, CI/CD pipelines, and SQL-based data modelling.
            I enjoy creating systems that are scalable, maintainable, and easy for others to work with.
            What sets me apart is that I combine analytical engineering skills with creativity from my game-development
            background. It allows me to think both technically and interactively, approach challenges from multiple
            angles, and build software that is not only correct, but also intuitive to use.
        </p>
